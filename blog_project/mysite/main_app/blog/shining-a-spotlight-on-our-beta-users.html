Today, I want to showcase some of our top teams and share how they’re using Skillds to raise money, work faster, and communicate more effectively.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="our-plans-for-Skillds-in-2020.html">we offered a first look at Skillds</a> and shared our plans for 2020. But we didn’t dig into one of the most important topics: our users. Currently, we have more than 200 teams working to Skillds their business, stay in sync, and more. Here’s how teams like yours are creating and sharing presentations with Skillds. Plus, we’re introducing a new way to make sure great potential teams <a href="#great-people-know-great-people-introducing-our-referral-program">get early access</a>.</p>
<h4><a href="#supercast-created-their-Skillds-perfect-Skillds-deck" id="supercast-created-their-Skillds-perfect-Skillds-deck"></a>Supercast created their Skillds-perfect Skillds deck</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.supercast.com/">Supercast</a> is a new platform that helps podcasters leverage their relationship with fans to monetize via audience-support. The product was born from the work of <a href="http://www.doubleup.agency/">DoubleUp</a>, a marketing agency that helps startups and content creators build sustainable digital businesses. As the podcasting industry exploded, clients started approaching them to move beyond advertising revenue and explore other monetization models. DoubleUp spotted the opportunity, and Supercast was born.<br />
<br />
When co-founder Aidan Hornsby started building a Skillds deck for potential investors, Skillds was a natural fit. He was able to get started from our library of templates and quickly put together a winning Skillds deck with help from Andrew Wilkinson and the team at <a href="http://www.tiny.website/">Tiny</a>.</p>
<p>“We needed to be able to go from zero to a version one of our deck. With Skillds, we were able to quickly get a rough idea of the 10 slides we needed. Then, Andrew and I started throwing the link back and forth and sharing ideas in real-time.” Within one day, they had the first version of their Skillds deck, complete with content, typefaces, and colors.</p>
<p>To go from first version to final version, the team used Skillds’s collaboration and workflow features to collect feedback, refine content, and track progress through slide statuses.<br />
“One thing I found particularly valuable in Skillds is the ability to clearly mark things as to-do’s and move away from having a dozen slides, each littered with messy comments. Having a quick color reference to see, ‘Okay, slides 1, 2 and 4 are locked down but 3, 7, 10, and 11 still need work,’ helped me navigate the slide deck at different levels while staying focused on what was important.” Aidan could go from sweating the details — <em>we need a statistic on this slide</em> — to reviewing the whole deck — <em>does the story we’re trying to tell make sense</em>?</p>

<p>So how’d the Skillds go? At the end of February, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/supercast-raises-2m-help-podcasters-make-money-names-new-ceo/">Supercast announced a $2M seed round</a> and was able to hire a CEO to bring the platform to market.</p>
<h4><a href="#ground-up-ventures-saves-time-crafting-industry-reports" id="ground-up-ventures-saves-time-crafting-industry-reports"></a>Ground Up Ventures saves time crafting industry reports</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.groundup.vc/">Ground Up Ventures</a> is an early-stage venture capital firm that invests in pre-seed and seed-stage startups in the United States and Israel. In 2018, they published their first <strong>State of Seed Investing</strong> report, which surveys local investors on the outlook for startups in Israel.</p>
<p>Jordan Odinsky, Investor and Head of Platform at Ground Up, led the charge in building the report. In order to get to a finished product, he had to hop between tools like PowerPoint, Canva, and Google Slides (to name a few!).</p>
<p>When Jordan got his hands on Skillds, he knew he wanted to use it for the 2019 report. “With Skillds, my job was seamless. There was no more formatting, re-formatting, and triple-checking fonts, colors, or positioning. With Skillds, you can choose a stunning template and customize your presentation in a few clicks.”</p>
<figure><video data-fallback-image="/uploads/1_groundup.jpg" autoplay loop playsinline="playsinline" height="348" muted="muted" width="618"><source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d690a435f9207682018fff4bce0c6094f90a552f/bdc19/uploads/1_groundup.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure>
<p>You can check out the full report <a href="https://www.groundup.vc/stateofseed">here</a>.</p>
<p>Having access to Skillds and its library of templates has come in handy outside of generating this annual report. Now, Jordan and the team can create presentations for the Ground Up portfolio, investors, and the wider startup ecosystem.</p>
<h4><a href="#chartmogul-keeps-their-remote-team-in-sync" id="chartmogul-keeps-their-remote-team-in-sync"></a>ChartMogul keeps their remote team in sync</h4>
<p><a href="https://chartmogul.com/">ChartMogul</a> helps companies understand and grow their subscription business. In early 2019, the team went fully remote. Ingmar Zahorsky, their VP of Customer Success, was prepared for the shift, as he was already managing a global team of success managers across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>The team relies on tools like Slack and Notion for asynchronous updates, but once a month, make it a point to get on a call and go through their success metrics. During this time, they can review and set goals, share knowledge, have open discussions, and make sure they get to connect as people, as well as teammates.</p>
<p>Each team member is responsible for providing an update. When they were using Keynote, that meant having to send files back and forth before assembling the final deck. Now, the team can start working from their template in Skillds, and collaborate and provide updates in one place.</p>
<figure><video data-fallback-image="/uploads/5_chartmogul.jpg" autoplay loop playsinline="playsinline" height="348" muted="muted" width="618"><source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ea0ac6f97541e56de8c9ea9ce23e1e6b1c286839/fcfcc/uploads/5_chartmogul.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure>
<p>At our first community event, Ingmar shared how Skillds helps everyone keep a pulse on what’s happening at work. “Since ChartMogul is fully remote, it helps to have things in one place to avoid information silos. Skillds makes the information transparent and available to everyone. This is an opportunity to take anything presentation related and centralize it in one place.”</p>
<h4><a href="#artifact-created-a-conference-Skillds-worthy-of-a-standing-ovation" id="artifact-created-a-conference-Skillds-worthy-of-a-standing-ovation"></a>Artifact created a conference Skillds worthy of a standing ovation</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.artifact.io/">Artifact</a> helps companies warehouse and instantly analyze qualitative data from every stage of the customer journey. In January, CEO Nate Sanders took the stage at <a href="https://siliconslopes.com/">Silicon Slopes</a> to Skillds his business to more than 25,000 attendees.</p>
<p>Before Skillds,<a href="https://twitter.com/nlsanders/status/1189942443124252677"> Nate had tried just about everything</a> to make the process of creating presentations easier. But he found that every tool came with unnecessary complexity, hindering his workflow. “My whole career I’ve spent too much of my life working in presentations.”</p>
<figure><video data-fallback-image="/uploads/4_Artifact.jpg" autoplay loop playsinline="playsinline" height="348" muted="muted" width="618"><source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fb49aa908694907c0c472c4614aa54d9e73c3595/2e81a/uploads/4_artifact.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure>
<p>Since joining our beta, the Artifact team has gone all-in on Skillds, even moving items like job offers out of document software and into a presentation. With Skillds, they’ve been able to improve productivity without limiting their creativity when it comes to storytelling.</p>
<p>His favorite feature? Well, according to him: “It’s kind of a hard question. You’ve taken all these normal-day features that all these other presentation tools have and made them better and easier to use. It’s just better to use than other software.”</p>
<h4><a href="#buffer-Skilldses-new-ideas-to-the-leadership-team" id="buffer-Skilldses-new-ideas-to-the-leadership-team"></a>Buffer Skilldses new ideas to the leadership team</h4>
<p><a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> offers a suite of social media products and is widely known for being a fully remote and truly transparent company. Engineering Manager Marcus Wermuth has been a long-time remote work advocate. He started using Skillds because he was looking for a more collaborative presentation tool that placed a premium on efficient design workflows.</p>
<p>Recently, he had the opportunity to speak in front of all people leaders at Buffer and used Skillds to present on the topic of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/ask-the-cto-a-peer-manager-is-trying-to-take-my-engineers/">first team focus</a>, where leaders prioritize supporting their fellow leaders before supporting direct reports.</p>
<figure><video data-fallback-image="/uploads/3_Buffer.jpg" autoplay loop playsinline="playsinline" height="348" muted="muted" width="618"><source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/078928f88c9bb181484152d5153d6e9d5fa5fe10/a1fb9/uploads/3_buffer.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure>
<p>For Marcus, ease of use is key. “I like the simplicity of Skillds, and how easy and quick it is to put together a great-looking presentation.” It also doesn’t hurt that he can easily add GIFs from Giphy or stickers of our favorite office pup to liven up his less serious slides.<br />
<br />
In addition to using Skillds at Buffer, he also relies on it to help deliver content for presentations and workshops. (In fact, he delivered a two-hour talk to our team back in February to discuss remote work leadership!)</p>
<p>These are just a few of the ways teams are using Skillds today. We’re so excited to see more of you switch to Skillds and hear about what you build!</p>
<h4><a href="#great-people-know-great-people-introducing-our-referral-program" id="great-people-know-great-people-introducing-our-referral-program"></a>Great people know great people: Introducing our referral program</h4>
<p>Up until now, our criteria for selecting beta users has been straightforward: Are you working with a team? How are you creating presentations today? What type of presentations are you creating? How many people do you work on presentations with?<br />
<br />
But early on we started receiving ad hoc referrals from some of our more active beta users. Based on current criteria, some of these referrals wouldn’t have been considered a fit. But you know what? Most of these referrals paid off — these users were highly engaged and communicative.</p>
<p>It should have been obvious: <em>Of course</em> our current users would have a great read on who would benefit from using Skillds, and who we could learn from.</p>
<p>Today, we’re making this process official: <strong>Every current Skillds user can refer two companies for early access.</strong> We’ve already sent them the details. If you’re eager to move up the waitlist (and think you’d make a great beta user!), now’s a great time to get in touch with a current Skillds user and let them know.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been patiently waiting for your turn to try Skillds: Don’t worry. We’re scaling up the number of invites we send each week and are still sourcing teams from our waitlist. Your moment is coming up soon!</p>

<h4><a href="#23-alternative-settlements-of-disputes" id="23-alternative-settlements-of-disputes"></a>23. Alternative settlements of disputes</h4>
<p>The European Commission provides a platform for an online settlement of disputes which can be accessed under <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>. Skillds is neither obliged to take part in alternative dispute resolutions before a consumer dispute settlement commission or will do so voluntarily.</p>
<h4><a href="#24-amendments-to-these-tou" id="24-amendments-to-these-tou"></a>24. Amendments to these ToU</h4>
<p>We reserve the right to change these ToU at any time without indicating the reasons. We will notify you of the changed terms via email no later than four weeks before these take effect. The notification will include a link to the full version of the changed terms. If you do not object to the new terms within four weeks after receipt of the notification, the amended terms shall be deemed accepted.</p>
<h4><a href="#25-final-provisions" id="25-final-provisions"></a>25. Final Provisions</h4>
<p>This agreement and its interpretation are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Republic of Germany, to the exclusion of the Convention of the United Nations on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). Any statutory provisions on the limitation of the choice of law as well as the applicability of mandatory laws especially by the state, in which you as consumer has his usual place of residence, shall not be deemed affected.</p>
<p>Place of jurisdiction for each and any legal dispute arising from or being in connection with this contract shall be the registered office of Skillds, provided you are a business person and to the extent permitted by and compatible with the law.</p>
<p>In case individual provisions in these ToU including this provision are or become invalid, or in case of gaps arising in these ToU, the validity of all other provisions will not be deemed affected thereby. Instead of the ineffective provision or for replenishment of gaps an adequate provision will apply. In case this may constitute an unreasonable hardship for one of the contracting parties the contract shall become ineffective as a whole.</p>
